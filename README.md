# APT-Groups-and-Operations-SQL

"An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a cyberattack executed by criminals or nation-states with the intent to steal data or surveil systems over an extended time period. The attacker has a specific target and goal, and has spent time and resources to identify which vulnerabilities they can exploit to gain access, and to design an attack that will likely remain undetected for a long time. That attack often includes the use of custom malware." Roger A. Grimes, CSO

This repository contains the data from "APT Groups and Operations" (https://apt.threattracking.com) in SQL. I made a few very light changes to correct grammatical mistakes and to make sure the code runs. I tested it with MySQL 5.6.
